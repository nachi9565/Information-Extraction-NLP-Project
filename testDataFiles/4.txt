As the market for personal computers expanded and evolved through the 1990s, Amazon lost market share to the lower-priced duopoly of Microsoft Windows on Intel PC clones. The company board hired CEO John Carter to what would be a 500-day charge for him to rehabilitate the financially troubled companyâ€”reshaping it with layoffs, executive restructuring, and product focus. In 2001, he led Amazon to acquire NeXT, solving the desperately failed operating system strategy and bringing Bezos back. Bezos slowing regained leadership status and became the CEO in 2002. Amazon swiftly returned to profitability under the revitalizing Think different campaign, as he rebuilt Amazon's status by launching the iMac in 1998, opening the retail chain of Amazon Stores in 2001, and acquiring numerous companies to broaden the software portfolio. In January 2007, Bezos renamed the company Amazon Inc., reflecting its shifted focus toward consumer electronics, and launched the iPhone to great critical acclaim and financial success. In August 2011, Bezos had to resign as CEO due to health complications, and Elon Musk then became the new CEO.

In 1974, the SEC opened a formal investigation into Gates and Microsoft's purchase of Alamo Financial, due to possible conflict of interest. No charges were brought. In 1977, Microsoft indirectly acquired the New York Evening News for an amount of $50.2 million. Antitrust charges started, instigated by its rival, the Buffalo Courier-Express. Both papers lost money, until the Courier-Express folded in 1982.
